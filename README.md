# Mask-Temp-Station

Currently, Temperature Checkups are done manually using Contactless Thermometer. Manual Checkups are inefficient and impractical. A viable alternative to such method is automatic touchfree station however modern automatic stations are expensive and hard to aquire. 

To solve these problems there is a raspberry pi project that automates the process of Temperature Checkup by using Facial Landmarking & Contactless IR Temperature Sensor and Mask Detection using Deep Learning Neural Network for less than $100.
